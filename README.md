# Fisher embedding

Code for the paper "Session Recommendation via Recurrent Neural Networks over Fisher Embedding Vectors"

## Information

The code contained in the root folder is the code used to run session-based recommendation experiments for the paper. The folder "gru4rec" contains modified code based on the original Gru4Rec code (https://github.com/hidasib/GRU4Rec), with the modifications:
- The `GRU4Rec` class has two additional initialization parameters: `preset_embeddings` and `embedding_transform_matrix`. These implement the modifications described in the paper.
- The `fit` method has an additional parameter, `reset=True`, which controls whether the fit continues to incrementally train the model or starts from scratch.

## Running the code

The files need to be modified to include the location of the train/test/content files before being run. The files used by us were the ones generated by the original code, https://github.com/frederickayala/item2item_fisher. The hyperparameter values are hard coded for the MovieLens experiments.

Evaluation is demonstrated by the 'evaluation.ipynb' jupyter notebook.
